Eloress
The Digital Witch
---
# Definitions:

elora;
The glow of any electronic device, gadget or light source. Incandescent light bulbs, Candles, and Fluorescent lights do not emit an elora. LED, LCD, CRT, and Plasma light sources all do emit an elora.

The elora of the cell phone after the power had gone out was both eery and reassuring.

eloress; A sorceress of the electronic. A digital witch. A person with an affinity to technology.
???
I coined the term for myself and it is  therefore specific to the female gender. Sorceress implies female sorceror, Likewise Eloress implies female self identity. However, I have no issues with male identified people self identifying as such, or genderqueer either. Genderqueer and male identified people are also welcome to think up an appropriate male or genderqueer suffix or modify the term in any way they see fit. The gender specificity is not relevant to the lesson.
