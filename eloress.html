Eloress
The Digital Witch
---
# Definitions:

elora;
The glow of any electronic device, gadget or light source. Incandescent light bulbs, Candles, and Fluorescent lights do not emit an elora. LED, LCD, CRT, and Plasma light sources all do emit an elora.

The elora of the cell phone after the power had gone out was both eery and reassuring.

eloress; A sorceress of the electronic. A digital witch. A person with an affinity to technology.
???
I coined the term for myself and it is  therefore specific to the female gender. 
Sorceress implies female sorceror, Likewise Eloress implies female self identity. 
However, I have no issues with male identified people self identifying as such, or genderqueer either. 
Genderqueer and male identified people are also welcome to think up an appropriate male or 
genderqueer suffix or modify the term in any way they see fit. 
The gender specificity is not relevant to the lesson.

# Elaboration:
Definitions of Shamen, Shameness are somewhat bound by tradition, History, and Cultural appreciation/appropriation.

Eloress however is not bound by any definition excepting that which I create for it. And So,

Eloress, one who uses technology to weave magic.
???
This can include performing music, and modifying previously recorded music via playback. 
The pretentious idea that a DJ is a Dancefloor Shamen is both disrespectful and absurd as most DJs have no interest, 
education, or capacity to heal through music.
---

A Eloress can be a DJ, and music performer and in such a capacity is at their most illustrative.
In this respect, an Eloress considers, binaural audio, rythem, frequency, and cultural cues.

---

An Eloress is also one who seeks to understand and work with and not against their technological tools. 
An Eloress has the ability to diagnose and fix issues within the tools they use and as a service to their community. 
She is for herself a tinkerer and for others a "Computer doctor". 
One of her most important aspects in this is teaching others how to get along with their devices and understand that computers are not faultless, but bound by the same physical parameters we and everything else in the world is.
